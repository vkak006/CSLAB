# Prediction of Glucose Concentration in Type 1 Diabetes Patients

The goal of this project was to implement a neural network that could successfully predict the high/low blood glucose levels in Type 1 Diabetes patients. Data for the project was obtained from the Jaeb Center for Health Research, where a clinical trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring.

Two types of neural networks were tested: a feedforward network, with 2 hidden layers, and a recurrent network with a single LSTM cell. TensorFlow was used to implement the networks - success of the networks were based on the RMS, number of lows identified, number of highs identified, and number of false points identified.
